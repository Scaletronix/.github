This repository stores the code for our school project in which we utilize a Raspberry Pi connected to a scale. The project allows for the calibration and measurement of objects using the scale, with live results displayed on our dashboard, which is written in ASP.NET Core/BlazorWASM and utilizes the MudBlazor frontend framework. Additionally, we have implemented the capability to save calibrated objects with their initial weight in a SQLite database and to select already calibrated objects from the database, eliminating the need for re-calibration.
